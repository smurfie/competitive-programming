# Competitive programming

This repos it is meant to hold solutions for different competitive programming platforms and contests in different languages.

It started only with JS and `Advent of Code` contest and then extended to `Codeforces` also in JS and Kotlin later

In the root there is a lib folder to be able to store/share some common code between folders

Each folder holds a platform and each one of those has its owns properties:

- Advent of Code: The most important is find a solution in a reasonable time for a given input. So sometimes reasonable means 1 minute because it is faster to wait than to program a faster solution. Also sometimes there are some restrictions added to the problem description because it makes the solution easier and works with the given input.
- Codeforces: Here you have to give a quick solution that passes all test cases so the correctness is key
