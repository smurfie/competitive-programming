# Codeforces JS & Kotlin Solutions

This folder contains solution for Codeforces contests made in Javascript (a few) and in Kotlin (most of them)

## How it works

For each year contest it has a folder with the solutions numbered with letters according to the problem.

Javascript solutions usually have a HTML file to see it working.

To test kotlin solution you'll have to configure your own environment. Also a Template.kt file is provided in the root
